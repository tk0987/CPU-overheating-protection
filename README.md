# CPU-overheating-protection
Get CPU temp, and shutdown machine if temp is too high


It's Python code. If You want to run this program in VSCode - simply press F5 or ctrl+F5. Same for Python IDLE.

Code requires Open hardware monitor running in the background. Otherwise it won't work.

Also, advertisment from source file:

# Worry about overheating your hardware?
# 
# Forget about it! Now your hardware will know, when to shutdown! 
# Especially useful with broken cooler or something like that...
# 
# 
# Do not forget to run Open Hardware Monitor, otherwise code below won't work.
# just make exe, then task scheduler... 
# 
# 
# I have X570 chipset, so other ways (like pyspectator) did not work for me. And psutil is for Linux...
